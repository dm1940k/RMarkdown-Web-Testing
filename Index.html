            I am a self taught programmer and data analyst in search of my first developer or data analysis position.
            I have chosen to focus on C# and ASP.NET for software, and R for data. I am also familiar with HTML, CSS, and Ruby.
            I'm very curious about what different languages can do. I am currently working to create a D&D dungeon generator, as well as this portfolio site.

            I have spent the last 6 years in liquor production and sales.
            As cocktail room manager I found myself using data in order to direct our menu and events program. 
            In my production role I learned to use Excel for recipe development, which opened my eyes to the possibilities programming offered
