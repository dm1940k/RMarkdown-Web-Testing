            I am a self taught programmer and data analyst in search of my first developer or data analysis position.
            I have chosen to focus on C# and ASP.NET for software, and R for data. I am also familiar with HTML, CSS, Excel, SQL, and Ruby.
            I am currently working to create a D&D dungeon generator, as well as this portfolio site. 
            The most compelling aspect of programming and data analysis for are the moments when I discover a new way to do something or solve a problem.

            I have spent the last 6 years in liquor production and sales.
            As cocktail room manager I found myself using data in order to direct our menu and events program. 
            In my production role I learned to use Excel for recipe development, which opened my eyes to the possibilities programming offered.

            I hope to continue to grow my depth and breath of knowledge in the skills above, and maybe even turn them towards my other interests, like mechanical design or carpentry.
