# RMarkdown-Web-Testing
This is a test space for getting R Markdown projects uploaded to Netlify.com with CSS formatting included

It will eventually become my online portfolio for storing data case studies, c# web apps, and personal projects like photography and wood working.

For now it is a free playground to learn basic web stuff, testing out C# projects, and hosting case studies completed in R Markdown.
